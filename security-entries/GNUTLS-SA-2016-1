    <td>File overwrite by setuid programs</td>
    <td>Setuid programs using GnuTLS 3.4.12 could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite
    and corrupt arbitrary files in the filesystem. This issue was introduced in GnuTLS 3.4.12
    with the GNUTLS_KEYLOGFILE environment variable handling via getenv() and fixed
    in GnuTLS 3.4.13 by switching to secure_getenv() where available.

    <b>Recommendation:</b> Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.4.13, or later versions.</td>
