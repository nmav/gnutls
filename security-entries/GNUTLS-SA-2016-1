    <td>File overwrite by setuid programs</td>
    <td>Setuid programs using GnuTLS 3.4.12 could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite
    and corrupt arbitrary files in the filesystem. This issue was introduced in GnuTLS 3.4.12
    and fixed in GnuTLS 3.4.13.

    <b>Recommendation:</b> Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.4.13, or later versions.</td>
