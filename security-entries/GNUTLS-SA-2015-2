    reported</a> that a ServerKeyExchange signature
    sent by the server is not verified to be in the acceptable by the client
    set of algorithms. That has the effect of allowing MD5 signatures
    (which are disabled by default) in the ServerKeyExchange message. It is not believed that this bug can
    be exploited because a fraudulent signature has to be generated in real-time which is not
    known to be possible. However, since attacks can only get better it is
    recommended to update to a GnuTLS version which addresses the issue.<br>

      <b>Recommendation:</b> Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.4.1, or 3.3.15.</td>
